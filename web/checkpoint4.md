Hello Professor,

PFA the submission for checkpoint #4.

Demo Link : https://winifier.herokuapp.com

We have attached the client side scripts of the application.
Also we have include the apk (Android Application Installer) in the apk directory.

Link to Android App: https://winifier.herokuapp.com/apk/winifier.apk

You can view the github pages for both the repositories to view the additional scripts
we required for other segments of the application built on top of the core algorithm.
